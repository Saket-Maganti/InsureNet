# InsureNet: Deep Learning for Insurance Churn Prediction

## Overview
InsureNet is a deep learning-based project that leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn in the insurance industry. The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue their policy and help businesses take proactive retention steps.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Model Architecture
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN model is used with multiple hidden layers to learn complex customer behavior patterns. The model is trained on a structured dataset using supervised learning techniques.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model training and evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics
- Confusion matrix and classification report for performance assessment
- Clean, modular code suitable for extension or production deployment

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main Jupyter notebook or script: `python churn_prediction.py` or open the `.ipynb` file
3. Review model performance and outputs

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Keras Tuner
- Model deployment as a REST API with Flask
- Integration with AWS S3 and SageMaker for cloud-based training
